# Fork the repository first (GitHub UI), then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StellarRoute.git
cd StellarRoute
```

### 2. Start Local Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:

- **PostgreSQL 15** on `localhost:5432`
- **Redis 7** on `localhost:6379`

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
cargo build
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### 5. Run the API Server (optional)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://stellarroute:stellarroute_dev@localhost:5432/stellarroute \
  cargo run -p stellarroute-api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Visit `http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui` for interactive API docs.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

| Branch            | Purpose                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `main`            | Stable, always passing CI       |
| `feature/<topic>` | New features or enhancements    |
| `fix/<topic>`     | Bug fixes                       |
| `docs/<topic>`    | Documentation-only changes      |
| `chore/<topic>`   | Tooling, CI, dependency updates |

**Always branch off `main`:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### Keeping Your Branch Up to Date

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Prefer rebasing over merging to keep a clean history.

---

## Code Style & Standards

### Rust

- Run `cargo fmt` before every commit — CI will reject unformatted code.
- Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and fix all lints.
- Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) for public APIs.
- Use `thiserror` for library error types and `anyhow` for application-level errors.
- Prefer `tracing` over `println!` / `eprintln!` for logging.
- Document public items with `///` doc comments.

### Contract Security Checks

CI enforces contract-focused static and dependency checks:

- `cargo clippy -p stellarroute-contracts --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo audit`

Run the same commands locally before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo clippy -p stellarroute-contracts --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo audit
```

```bash
# Handy pre-commit check
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

### General

- Keep functions and modules small and focused.
- Write self-documenting code; add comments only when _why_ isn't obvious.
- Avoid `unwrap()` in production paths — use `?` or explicit error handling.
- No `unsafe` code (enforced by workspace lint).

---

## Testing Requirements

Every code contribution **must** include appropriate tests.

| Change type          | Required tests                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New endpoint         | Integration test (can be `#[ignore]` with DB) + unit test for response model |
| Bug fix              | Regression test that would have caught the bug                               |
| New utility / helper | Unit tests covering happy path and edge cases                                |
| Refactor             | Existing tests must continue to pass                                         |

### Running Tests

For the full matrix of Rust, contract, integration, benchmark, and frontend Vitest guidance, see [docs/development/testing-guide.md](docs/development/testing-guide.md).

```bash
# All unit tests (no external deps needed)
cargo test

# Include ignored integration tests (requires running DB)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://stellarroute:stellarroute_dev@localhost:5432/stellarroute \
  cargo test -- --include-ignored

# A single crate
cargo test -p stellarroute-api
```

Integration tests that require a live database should be marked with `#[ignore = "requires DATABASE_URL"]` and documented accordingly (see `crates/api/tests/` for examples).

## Pull Request Process

### Before Opening a PR

- [ ] Your branch is rebased on the latest `main`
- [ ] `cargo fmt` passes with no changes
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes
- [ ] `cargo test` passes (all non-ignored tests)
- [ ] New or updated tests are included
- [ ] No `todo!()` / `unimplemented!()` / debug `println!` left in production paths

### Opening the PR

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `StellarRoute:main`.
3. Fill in the PR template:
   - Summary of changes
   - Motivation / linked issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)
   - Testing performed
4. Request a review — maintainers aim to respond within **48 hours**.

### Review Checklist (for reviewers)

- [ ] Code is correct and handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Tests are meaningful and cover edge cases
- [ ] Public APIs are documented
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity introduced
- [ ] Follows project conventions (naming, module structure)
- [ ] CI is green

For new or significantly changed swap UI components, also complete the
[Swap UI component review checklist](frontend/STORYBOOK.md#swap-ui-component-review-checklist).
It covers accessibility, loading and error states, mobile behavior,
internationalization readiness, and manual pair selection regressions.

### After Feedback

Push additional commits to your branch; the PR will update automatically. Avoid force-pushing after a review has started unless asked to squash/rebase.

## Good First Contributions

Not sure where to start? Here are some ideas:

- 🟢 Issues tagged [`good-first-issue`](../../issues?q=label%3Agood-first-issue) — well-scoped tasks with clear requirements
- 🔵 Issues tagged [`beginner-friendly`](../../issues?q=label%3Abeginner-friendly) — minimal project context needed
- 📝 Improve or expand documentation in `docs/`
- 🧪 Add tests for existing, untested code paths
- 🐛 Fix a known bug from the issue tracker

**New to Rust?** That's fine! Start with a documentation or testing issue and work your way up. Maintainers are happy to review Rust code and suggest idiomatic improvements.

**New to Stellar?** Read the [Stellar Developer Docs](https://developers.stellar.org) and the project [README](README.md) to get a feel for the domain, then pick a backend or tooling issue.

## Secrets Rotation Checklist

When rotating credentials (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, SOROBAN_RPC_URL), follow this checklist to ensure zero downtime and security:

1. **Database Credentials**:
   - [ ] Create a new database user with the same permissions.
   - [ ] Update the environment variable in the staging environment.
   - [ ] Verify that the service starts correctly (startup checks will pass).
   - [ ] Deploy the change to production.
   - [ ] Monitor logs for connection errors.
   - [ ] Once all instances are updated, revoke the old user's credentials.

2. **Redis Credentials**:
   - [ ] Update the password in Redis (if applicable, using `CONFIG SET requirepass`).
   - [ ] Update the environment variable in the application.
   - [ ] Restart the application.

3. **Soroban RPC URL/API Keys**:
   - [ ] If using a provider with API keys, generate a new key.
   - [ ] Update the environment variable.
   - [ ] Verify connectivity via startup checks.
   - [ ] Deactivate the old API key.

**Security Reminder**: Never log full connection strings. Our configuration system masks these automatically in `Debug` output. If you add new sensitive environment variables, ensure they are also masked.
