# `/api/v1/routes` — Multi-Route Trading Endpoint

Returns multiple **ranked route candidates** for a given trading pair. This endpoint is optimizer-driven: it exposes the execution paths scored by the `HybridOptimizer`, enabling clients (UI, SDKs, wallets) to display alternatives and let users choose.

`/api/v1/quote` intentionally uses a different selection rule. It performs a direct-venue comparison and returns the best executable single-hop price for the requested pair. That means the "best" result from `/quote` can differ from the first entry returned by `/routes` when the optimizer prefers a multi-hop path or a different tradeoff between output, impact, and hop count.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/routes/:base/:quote
```

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:base` | Selling asset — `native`, `USDC`, or `USDC:ISSUER` |
| `:quote` | Buying asset — same format as `:base` |

---

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Max | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-----|-------------|
| `amount` | `f64` | `1` | — | Trade amount (in asset units) |
| `limit` | `usize` | `5` | `20` | Maximum number of routes to return |
| `max_hops` | `usize` | `3` | `6` | Maximum hops per route |
| `environment` | `string` | `production` | — | Optimizer policy (`production`, `testnet`) |

---

## Example Request

```
GET /api/v1/routes/native/USDC:GA5ZSEJ...?amount=100&limit=3&max_hops=2
```

## Ranking Logic

Routes are ranked by their **composite score**, computed by the `HybridOptimizer` using:

- **Estimated output** — higher output = better score
- **Price impact** (`impact_bps`) — lower impact = better score
- **Hop count** — fewer hops preferred unless output significantly improves
- **Policy weights** — configurable per environment (`production` vs `testnet`)

The first route in the array is the recommended best route for the optimizer.

If you want the cheapest direct venue for a single hop, use `/api/v1/quote`. If you want the optimizer's best executable route, use `/api/v1/routes`.

## Per-Hop Metadata

Each `path` entry exposes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `from_asset` | Input asset for this swap leg |
| `to_asset` | Output asset for this swap leg |
| `price` | Exchange rate at this hop (7 decimal places) |
| `amount_out_of_hop` | Expected output amount after fees |
| `fee_bps` | Fee charged by this venue in basis points |
| `source` | Venue identifier (`sdex`, `amm:pool-id`) |

---

## Error Responses

| HTTP Code | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| `400` | Invalid asset format, non-positive amount, or unknown environment |
| `404` | No executable route found between the two assets |
| `500` | Internal graph or computation failure |

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Zero DB per request**: The routing graph is maintained in-memory by the background `GraphManager`, syncing from the database every 5 seconds.
- **Thread safety**: BFS pathfinding runs inside `tokio::spawn_blocking` to prevent blocking the async runtime.
- **Deduplication**: Concurrent identical requests are collapsed via `SingleFlight` to prevent thundering herd.
- **OpenAPI**: Documented via `utoipa::path` — visible in the `/docs` Swagger UI.
